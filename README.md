Randi’s Todo List App
Welcome to Randi's Todo List! This app is where I keep track of all the things I need to do and maybe—just maybe—actually get them done. 😅 Whether it's finding that missing sock or writing code (or both!), this app has got my back.

🛠️ Technologies Used
React for the front-end framework (because it’s awesome!).
useReducer to manage state in a neat and clean way (no more "useState spaghetti" here).
useState for local state management, like tracking new todos, editing, and more.
Some good old CSS for styling and making things look pretty.
